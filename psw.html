    <p style="color: blue;">It was a college miniproject (apr 2023- june 2023)</p>

    <p style="align-items: center; color: rgb(28, 9, 46);">In collaboration with ICAR, I spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge web application aimed at addressing a critical agricultural challenge: detecting Pseudo Stem Weevil (PSW) in banana plants. Driven by a passion for emerging technology in agriculture, I designed and implemented a robust backend infrastructure using Python, while crafting a seamless, user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. To ensure highly accurate detection, I incorporated algorithms, such as Melspectrogram and Cosine similarity, and utilized thousands of PSW audio clips as a comprehensive dataset. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also underscored my commitment to creating innovative solutions for real-world agricultural issues.</p>
